                              <p>This blog is for the class of Database System by Marko Schutz. Here will be all the information or you can say learned class material by the past of the days or month on this
                              Second Semester of 2017. </p>
                              <p>A little information about this class is that Database is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports,
                              views, and other objects. The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as modelling the availability
                              of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>
                              <p> While a database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user,
                              other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.
                              Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, SAP HANA, MemSQL and IBM DB2.</p>
                              <p>So you can say that a database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but
                              different DBMS can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. Database management systems are often classified
                              according to the database model that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the SQL language. Sometimes a DBMS
                              is loosely referred to as a 'database'.</p>

                                <p>At first learning about the relational model, were a little difficult to me because I didn't understood how to relate ALL the material ._. 
                                Later on the class on the presentations I could finally understand how to use this relational model. The attributes, tuples and schemas were the concepts I didn't get
                                to know what was the purpose of them to implement in the lab1. I keep searching and trying to learn about how to use this to create schema tables. Later on, I could understand how
                                to use them, then I notice that it was QUITE easy!. I was struggling with such an easy task of logical matter ._.</p>

                                <p>This time learning in this class was somewhat fun... because... you can say that we were using algebraic expressions implemented in CODING which
                                is the first time I have ever done before such a great experience. At first I was scared by presenting because I didn't know if I was saying something wrong I might 
                                saying some non-sense in front of everyone ._. </p>
                                <p> Anyways, I learn how to use the relational algebra using the operators of project, select, natural join, theta join, etc. At first, I try to imagine how was the operators working, 
                                I didn't know what it was projecting in each of the exercises but later on, I learn how a relational algebra worked. If we do a projection we use &pi; and selection we use &sigma; ... 
                                    to the natural join differencing of the theta join is that the theta join can have a condition between 2 attributes while a natural join does not have any condition. Natural join is &#x2a1d; if theta join will have a subletter as condition.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">Week Class of <span class="year">February 6 to 10, 2017</span></h3>
                                <p>At this week I have the class of Theory Design so… that’s chapter 3 of the book The Complete by Ullman. There, we started by the Functional Dependencies (FD), which at first was a difficult topic for me. So, FD are the relation R of a statement that form, 
                                    so if two tuples agrees on all of the attributes a1, a2, a3...an then they will also agree on all attributes b1, b2, b3...bm.</p>

                                <p> So we can say that if <strong> a </strong> → <strong> b </strong> we can only be sure that if a relation R is a FD true, is that if R satisfy the FD. In other words, is a constraint that describes the relationship between attributes in a relation.</p>
                                <p> For this week of class the lab 3 was about the FD so I didn’t present because I was afraid that I was wrong of doing the work. But anyways, I will discuss about at least one exercise. I was ask to sear all the FD relation of each schema in the problem. 
                                    I will say some of them. As you all know, SSN has a lot of connections between, I mean, each person has a unique SSN so we can be found or register by that number. What kind of connections has the SSN? I will say, has a TONS of information, 
                                    I mean is connected by my name, street address, city, including my phone number and so many more information. So, let say that SSN functionally determine name, street address, city, including my phone number, so  for sake of simplicity we say  SSN → name, street address, city, phone number. </p>
                            </div><!--//item-->

                                <p>At this week we continue discussing about Functional Dependencies,  and some subtopic is the BCNF (Boyce-Codd-Normal-Form). In the BCNF, the relation R is in BCNF if, whenever there is a nontrivial FD a1,...an→b1….bm then {a1,....an} is a superkey for R. For example the left side of every nontrivial FD contains a key.</p>
                                
<p>At for the week per see, the discussion later on was on the third normal form, and fourth normal form, Chase, Test, Lossless Join etc. Most of the difficult is to understand at first is the FD, then to understand the BCNF to later apply the 3rd Normal Form. At the lab 4, I present the work  the exercise of a relation schema R (A, B, C) with FD A -> B. Suppose also that we decide to decompose this schema into S (A, B) and T (B, C). Give an example of an instance of relation R whose projection onto S and T and subsequent rejoining that does not yield the same relation instance. So, what I did was a table with some values. For example: </p>
<center><p>Here we have that the relation R contains 2 tuples</p></center>
<center><table>
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr></table></center>
<br/>
<center><p> In here, the view of the tables is the division of the first relation. So the effects of R in the relations with schemas S{A, B} is: </p></center>
 <center><table>

  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr> </table></center>

<br /> <br/> <center><p> And the schema T{B, C} is: </p></center>
<center><table> 

  <tr>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr></table></center><br/><br/>
<center><p> The result of a natural join with two relation, but the result of the natural join is not equal to the original relation R.</p></center>
<center><table>
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
</table></center>

                                <p>At this week, we continue with the Theory Design at the topic of applying the 3rd Normal Form.Using the BCNF as base we can know how to identify if violates or not the Third Normal Form, whenever the schemas of A1…..An → B1….Bm so to determine that does not violate the 3NF have some rules they are: </p>
                             <ul>
        <li>BCNF</li>
        <li>Has to be prime</li>
        <li>Has to be non-trivial or a superkey</li>
    </ul>
<p>So having this rules in mind we can identify if the FD are 3NF or not. Another topic was the multivalue dependencies. Which the has also some rules to be identified. The FD are trivial, transitive. But a way more understandable is that A→→B which means that A multideterminates B. Which A can contains each information that B has if B has an information of C, D and E all the values, now A all that information making A a superkey (if the schema is R(ABCDE)). </p>
<p> As for this week lab5 was assign to find the 3NF and Multivalue Dependencies. So I did which of the schemas violate the 3NF and the first one didn't have any problems, but the second was a little complicated because remembering that the 3NF have 3 rules about the BCNF, prime, nontrivial or superkey well non of the FD given were neither of the rules. So violate the rule of 3NF</p>

                                <p>At this week we start with chapter 4 that’s about the High-Level Database Model. Which this topic was not-entirely material is easy to understand because has some ups and downs. So understanding the E/R Model (Entity/Relationship Model) which uses three principal element types, they are : </p>
                                <ul>     
                                    <li> Entity</li>
                                    <li>Attributes</li>
                                    <li>Relationships</li> 
                                </ul>
<p> So in making some relationships are a bit complicated per se because you at first you must know about the schemas to easy way of understanding what’s an attribute, entities, and including the relations. Relationships, well must be related with the entity for example. A studio is an entity but own is a relationship so… I will say first … Relationship most of the time has to be many-to-many, or many-one (there’s also many to exactly or most one). So if we have 2 entities of studio and Movies and a relationship of own… so we can say that a Movie own many-one relationship with studio but you know that a Movie can have not only one studio can have many… so that depends of the assumptions made by the describer. </p>
<p> At for this week I did somewhat lab6 that was about a flight and customers…. So I will say this. I DID IT CORRECTLY finally ;-; So I did that the customer (entity) has a many-to-many relationship named booked with an attribute (seats) many-to-many with flight. </p>

                               <p>For this week we started the weak relationships. Is somewhat more complicated than the relationship per se. So I might have to be careful ;-; Hmm what can I say, is the same explanation that the past week material but with something more. For example, if I have a weak entity name crew then I must have a weak relationship with a strong entity name studio. 
At the same time, we discuss about the UML. Which was pretty complicated at first but a little practice was needed to understand all the terms.
</p>
<p>As for the lab7 I choose the exercise 1 which I need to eliminate the redudant information being in a E/R model given. So As I could see in the E/R model given I eliminate the attribute of address because was redundant having it 2 times which doesn’t makes sense letting 2 attributes that makes the same function but only in different area WHICH was not necessary having 2 we could have only 1 and that was okay. Another thing that it was redundant was the entity set of AccSet because the E/R model have already another entity of Accounts so I eliminate that entity of AccSet. </p>

                                <p>At this week was the test which I found it really "coje bobo" because I study more of the Relational Algebra and BAM ;-; I got stuck with the difficult material of E/R model.</p>
                                <p>Another part of this week was the ... lab8 and 9!!!! Well this lab was the material of weak entity and relationships and a little of UML (in the lab8) and lab9 was about Algebraic and Logical Query Languages. So I did the UML exercise which was to explain how to convert them into relations.</p>

                                <p>In this week we have 2 labs xD. So this time we start with another material of The Database Language SQL which I was WAITING about this material!! Well, At first I was thinking that it was easy as pie but well no, has some rules. We need first to test it in a terminal or whatsoever linux database to see if really runs. So each command is on the line to run or not. So we can start saying that we need some commands right? Well the commands are SELECT, FROM and WHERE, with this commands we can at least create a database schema. For example: </p>
                                <ul> 
                                    <p>Schema of Movies(title,year,length,genre,studioName,producerC#) so we would like to know all of the movies produced by Disney Studios in 1990 so in SQL language we do this: </p>
                                    <li>SELECT *</li>
                                    <li>FROM Movies</li>
                                    <li>WHERE studioName = ‘Disney’ AND year = 1990;</li>

                                <p>About the lab10 and lab11, I did the problem2 of lab10, well I got in trouble at some point because I didnt know how to include the exact words. So I was doing it but the part of assigning the word of "love" was meant to be written with‘%love%’ so the command will understand what exactly you want to do with this word. Overall, I did fine.</p>

                                <p>At this week we continue with the chapter 6 and starting with chapter 7. But what I remember was working with the lab 12 which was very complicated for me, I will say, I couldnt understand well how to use the OR, AND, ALL, EXIST, IN, ANY,.. etc. But getting into practice I was able to solve one of the problems. I present the exercise 1 because was similar to the last time lab 10. So I begun discussing and them I was trouble again explaining why I did include an IN command. But since the problem said that Find the manufacturers of cars with a top speed of at least 120. So I did: </p>
                                <ul>
                                     <li>SELECT manufacturer</li>
                                    <li>FROM Vehicle</li>
                                    <li>WHERE model IN (SELECT model FROM Car WHERE topSpeed >=120);</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I will say I did well right? ._. </p>
